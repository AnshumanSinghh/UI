======= WINDOWS OBJECT =======
It represents the physical window on the computer screen that displays all of their content.

>>> Some properties of windows:

1. windows.onpopstate:

2. windows.innerHeight : represents the height of the user's window (in pixels).

3. windows.innerWidth : how wide is the user's window (in pixels).

4. windows.scrollY : how many pixels far down we have scrolled (at top of the page it is zero).
 
JavaScript also provide us another object called document object. Well, the document
represents the entire web page, but if webpages are long, oftentimes a web page doesn't
fit entirely inside of the window.

5. document.body.offsetHeight : It represents how tall the entire height of the document is.

>>> If the user is at the bottom of the page it means: scrollY + innerHeight must be at least or equal
    to document.body.offsetHeight.

In JavaScript document.addEventListener can takes an optional argument the event itself, which is a JavaScript
object that contains information about the event that happened, like the clcik event, or the scroll event, or the 
keydown event or the keyup event, for exapmle.
One of the properties we get access to is:
event.target means what was the target of the event(what event actually happened).
