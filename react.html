    <script type="text/babel"> // we have used type="text/babel" to mean Babel should translate this code from JSX to 
                               // plain JavaScript that the web browser is able to understand. 

    class Hello extends React.Component {
            render() {
                return (
                    <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}!</h1>

                // rather than just include JavaScript here, I can atually include HTML-like syntax as what I return.

                    <h2>Hello, REACT!</h2>
                    <Hello name="Anshuman Singh" />  I can reuse the component again and again and also in another componenet too.
                    <Hello name="Ashutosh Kumar" />  we can use another arguments (known as props in React) same as what looks like HTML arguments. That we 
                                                     can put as parameters to a particular HTML tag, like attributes on an HTML element, 
                                                     that we can access those attributes, otherwise known as props, inside of a React Component and now
                                                     we acan access these properties by using this.props.name inside curly braces. 

                    <Hello name="Amit Kumar" />
                </div>
            );
        }

    }
    // now we have the component so the last step is to say, lets go ahead
    // and render into the DOM.
    ReactDOM.render(<App/>, document.querySelector('#app'));
